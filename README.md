## 1) What is an image:

#### **An image is a two-dimensional array (matrix) of pixels, where each pixel represents a color or intensity value.**
##### - In grayscale images, each pixel is a single value from 0 (black) to 255 (white).
##### - In colored images (RGB/BGR), each pixel is a combination of three values (Red, Green, and Blue or Blue, Green, and Red), each ranging from 0 to 255.
